# Movie-Recommendation-syatem
This will deal with 'data manipulation' with pandas, Numpy, and  'data visualization' with Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries with the Movie dataset. After Data manipulation and 
Data visualization, an ML model will be built on the Movie dataset to create a model/system which can recommend a movie according to the user's previous choice.
